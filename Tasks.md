    *   ✅ Implement `stopRecordingAndProcess` (trigger background processing).
    *   ✅ Implement `RecordingStatusBar` UI.
    *   ✅ Refactor Home Screen record button.

## Cloud Integration (Supabase)

*   🔄 **Cloud Persistence & Sync:**
    *   🔄 Setup & Configuration (Project, Packages, iOS Setup - needs Android)
    *   ✅ Authentication (Context, Screens, Navigation, Sign Out - basic iOS done)
    *   ⏳ Storage (Audio File Upload/Download)
    *   ⏳ Security Rules

---

## UI/UX Enhancements

*   ✅ Improve Transcription UI Feedback (Loading/Processing states in `TranscriptionScreen` - Partially done, review needed).
*   ✅ **Transcription History/Library:** Improve UI for sermon list on `HomeScreen`.
    *   ✅ Refactor list rendering using `SectionList`.
    *   ✅ Refine card styling to match target UI.
*   ✅ Refine UI Consistency Across Screens (Styles, Spacing, Borders - Ongoing).
*   ✅ Replace Emoji Icons with Vector Icons (`@expo/vector-icons`).
*   ✅ Enhance Transcript Display (Paragraph formatting with clickable timestamps).
*   ✅ Review and refine Home Screen UI (inspired by Otter.ai mocks - partially addressed by card styling).

---

## Technical Debt & Refactoring

*   ✅ Typing (API responses, Props, Contexts).
*   ✅ Logging (Implement more structured logging, potentially integrate Sentry/Expo Error Reporter).
*   ✅ Refactor AsyncStorage access into dedicated utility/hook.

*   ✅ Code Cleanup (remove unused code/comments, ensure consistency).

---
